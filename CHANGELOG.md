# v0.2.2

Minting functions for exact mints and by_prefix mints. A experimental cip68 prefix has been added to prefixes.

# v0.2.1

CIP68 prefixes have been fixed. The unique token name function still produces correct names but any length checks needs to be adjusted. New prefix length is now 4.

# v0.1.6

Does not work with Aiken versions below v1.0.7-alpha Aiken and v1.1.0 Stdlib.

## Changes

Fake Tx is updated with new `MintedValue` type.
Value add is now value merge. All Values functions have been updated.

# v0.1.5 and below

Works with v1.0.6-alpha Aiken and v1.0.0 Stdlib
